          Our transportation infrastructure serves 102.7 million passenger
          journeys annually, representing a healthy 4.8% year-over-year growth
          that reflects increasing public trust and utilization. The network
          spans 32,929 kilometers of active rail infrastructure complemented by
          877,000 kilometers of road coverage, providing comprehensive
          connectivity across the region. System performance remains strong,
          with passenger satisfaction consistently maintained between 80-90%,
          indicating effective service delivery and operational reliability.
          This integrated multi-modal approach continues to support regional
          mobility needs while demonstrating capacity for sustained growth and
          quality service standards.

              Weekdays see consistent usage between 1.5-1.7M daily passengers,

              Fridays consistently record the lowest weekday ridership
              (~1.52-1.56M), suggesting remote work adoption and early weekend
              departures.

              August 22 saw the period's lowest weekday usage at 1.48M‚Äîa 10%
              drop from typical Thursdays, potentially due to weather

              Sydney and Melbourne dominate Australia's public transport
              landscape, collectively accounting for 75% of all passenger trips
              nationwide.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sydney leads with 711 million annual trips, approximately 125
              trips per resident. The city relies heavily on buses and heavy
              rail for the majority of its journeys.
            </p>
            <p>
              Melbourne's iconic tram network is the world's largest, handling
              significant passenger volumes and contributing to the city's 469
              million annual trips.
            </p>
            <p>
              Per capita: Both major cities average around 120 trips per person
              annually, significantly higher than other Australian capitals,
              highlighting the concentration of public transport investment and
              usage in the two largest metropolitan areas.

              Private vehicles dominate at 63.6% of all trips, reflecting
              Australia's car-dependent infrastructure and urban sprawl. Air
              travel represents 17.1%, highlighting the nation's reliance on
              aviation for long-distance connectivity across its vast geography.

              Nearly five decades of continuous growth from 1975 to 2020 saw
              passenger volumes surge from 120 billion to 290 billion km. The
              dramatic 2020-21 COVID-19 impact caused an unprecedented 50%
              decline, with passenger cars dropping to pre-1995 levels. Recovery
              remains incomplete, with 2023-24 figures still 8% below peak.
            </p>
            <p>
              Monthly patronage fluctuates between 36-46 million passengers,
              with February peaking at 42.7M and June lowest at 37.8M. Winter
              months (June-August) consistently show reduced usage, while
              February and October register the highest activity, suggesting
              seasonal commuting patterns tied to academic calendars and holiday
              periods.
