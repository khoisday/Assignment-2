          Our transportation infrastructure serves 102.7 million passenger
          journeys annually, representing a healthy 4.8% year-over-year growth
          that reflects increasing public trust and utilization. The network
          spans 32,929 kilometers of active rail infrastructure complemented by
          877,000 kilometers of road coverage, providing comprehensive
          connectivity across the region. System performance remains strong,
          with passenger satisfaction consistently maintained between 80-90%,
          indicating effective service delivery and operational reliability.
          This integrated multi-modal approach continues to support regional
          mobility needs while demonstrating capacity for sustained growth and
          quality service standards.

              August 22 saw the period's lowest weekday usage at 1.48M—a 10%
              drop from typical Thursdays, potentially due to weather

              Sydney and Melbourne dominate Australia's public transport

              Sydney leads with 711 million annual trips, approximately 125
              trips per resident. The city relies heavily on buses and heavy
              rail for the majority of its journeys.
            </p>
            <p>
              Melbourne's iconic tram network is the world's largest, handling
              significant passenger volumes and contributing to the city's 469
              million trips.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both major cities average around 120 trips per person annually,
              significantly higher than other Australian cities, highlighting
              the concentration of public transport investment and usage in the
              two largest areas.

              Private vehicles dominate at 63.6% of all trips, reflecting
              Australia's car-dependent infrastructure and urban sprawl. Air
              travel represents 17.1%, highlighting the nation's reliance on
              aviation for long-distance connectivity across its vast geography.

              Nearly five decades of continuous growth from 1975 to 2018 saw
              passenger volumes surge from 120 billion to over 280 billion km.
              The dramatic 2020-21 COVID-19 impact caused an unprecedented
              decline, with passenger cars dropping to 2000s levels. Recovery
              remains incomplete, with 2023-24 figures still 5 billion
              kilometers below peak.

              Monthly patronage ranges from 36.1M (January) to 45.9M (March).
              The highest usage occurs in March (45.9M), October (45.7M), and
              August (45.1M), while January and June show the lowest activity at
              36.1M and 37.8M respectively. The January dip reflects summer
              holiday periods, with recovery patterns aligning with the academic
              calendar and seasonal work commutes.

            Private transport usage varies dramatically across Australia, with
            clear patterns emerging between urban cores and outer suburbs.
            Inner-city areas with dense public transport networks—particularly
            Sydney's eastern suburbs, Melbourne's CBD corridor, and central
            areas near major rail lines—show the lowest private vehicle
            dependence (10-20%). In contrast, outer regions and car-dependent
            areas register 40-50% private transport usage, reflecting limited
            public transport access and longer commute distances. Remote and
            regional Australia displays low private transport percentages due to
            sparse population density. This geographic divide underscores the
            infrastructure gap: well-serviced inner zones enable public
            transport adoption, while outer suburbs remain reliant on private
            vehicles, highlighting the need for expanded transit coverage in
            growth corridors.
